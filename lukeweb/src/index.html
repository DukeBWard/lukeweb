        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
            Hey, my name's Luke Ward and I'm an undergraduate B.S. Computer Science student at Rochester Institute of technology (R.I.T).  
        </p>

        <p>
            I've spent a lot of my time working with computer, mentoring and tutorting students, and spending time outdoors.  Throughout all of my life I've been interested in technology, from gaming to building my own Personal Computer and other side projects just out of curiosity.  Now, I am always working on a small project alongside my rigorous course work to keep my curious mind sated.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm currently looking for a Software Engineering/Development Co-op, willing to relocate anywhere.<br><br>
            I have experience in Python 🐍, Java ☕️, Javascript, C, C++, HTML, and CSS.
